# TODO

* More, better feature extraction
    * Use relationship between strokes
    * Improve both the skeleton and path generating algorithms and extract more and better features from them
* Human-like digit generation

## Comparisons with other models when trained on single data set

* incorporate lesson from knn: pixel location must matter in
* decisions trees, random forest, adaboost, svm

## Code

* use assertthat
* don't code an island
