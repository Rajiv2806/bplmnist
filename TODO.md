# TODO

## Presentation

* include proportional for
* deep learning v bpl: deep in data and computation, this shallow, but deep in programmatic knowledge, babies vs adults
* performance digression [hadley/lineprof](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Profiling.html#measure-perf)
* description of "feature extraction process"
* plots of performance
* "edge" detection is done via this thinning process (link to thinning process?)

## Room for improvement in program

* determination of relationship between strokes
* leverage 2-d nature of pixels, e.g. not just present or not present but may be useful in edge detection

## Comparisons with other methods trained on single training set

* compare with tangent distance
* knn
* multinom / nnet

## Code

* update simulations to use whole data set and randomize training set
* use assertthat
