# TODO

* Visual Turing Tests: Generate new random digits
* more, better feature extraction
* use relationship between strokes
* potential to improve both the thinning and path generating algorithms and extract more and better features from them

## Comparisons with other models when trained on single data set

* knn with l1, l2, tangent distance
* multinom / nnet

## Code

* use assertthat
* never code on an island
